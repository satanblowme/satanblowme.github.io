ok so i don't know where this post is going to go. i figured out (roughly) that editing the style sheet for the html site itself will alter how things look, but the interface remains about the same. what i don't understand is how to make the site navigable from the perspective of a phone sized screen. also i don't understand the organization of posts and images and such. how do i create new categories? how do i make the link show up on the homepage? will this post autopopulate to the post index? i don't friggin know


answer: they do autopopulate in the index. note that the navigation links don't work unless at full screen. this will be an issue for viewing from a phone.
