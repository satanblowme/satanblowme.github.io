today i made a post and i don't really know what i'm doing.
i like this theme but i don't know how it is different from a layout, and i don't understand why there are three stylesheets and how to edit them bc they are all in shortcode on literally one line so that's cool. hope i can figure out how to change the fucking colors on this bullshit blinking shit.
